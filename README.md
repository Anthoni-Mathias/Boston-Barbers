## Description

> This is My second Milestone Project at Code Institute. In this project I will create an interactive website with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

> Boston Barbers Bar is a BaberShop with the goal to reach out the local community to showcase their style and to add possibility for costumers to book a time for hair cut or shave beard. This is reached with a neat design with only relevant features and intuitive interactivity to get a clear and good user experience.
