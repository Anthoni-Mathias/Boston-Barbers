## Description

> This is My second Milestone Project at Code Institute. In this project I will create an interactive website with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

> Boston Barbers Bar is a BaberShop with the goal to reach out the local community to showcase their style and to add possibility for costumers to book a time for hair cut or shave beard. This is reached with a neat design with only relevant features and intuitive interactivity to get a clear and good user experience.

### Strategy

> To align with the Business goals potential customer research has been done to answer some questions:
>
> - What do you most use this kind of website for?
> - What do you do before/after using this kind of website?
> - What makes a good experience?
> - What do you expect when visiting this kind of website?

> The result from this research is a website with only a few key functions to accomplish what the customers are looking for. A simple, not so busy site with clear steps to take to do what we want.

### Scope

> Features in scope for the first release:
>
> - Navigation Scroll to function.
> - Interactive Services to view only the section of your choice (Gents Haircut, Beard, Color Highlight, Call out Home Services).

> - The possibility to actually make the purchase from the basket.
> - Add information about purchase, how long it will take and real time update.
> - The possibility to see available slots to book a table function in real time.

### Structure

> - All interactions will only happen on intuitive and on user action with a clear feedback what is happening.
> - It will be a natural flow with a big hero image at the top to create interest, below that the Services followed by a Gallery, Book a table and last contact.
> - Only short and relevant information in form of text throughout the website to not distract the customer.

### Skeleton

### Bugs found and fixed during development:

> - scrollIntoView function scrolled too far due fixed navbar. Fixed by creating a div above the section to scroll to instead.
> - Sometimes when trying to add items to cart twice you are too far scrolled down to see the alert. This issue was fixed to always scrollIntoView to the alert when this happens.
> - On mobile size screens its easy to be to far scrolled down on the page to see the alerts when not filling out the forms correctly. This was fixed to scrollIntoView to alert section when this happens. This only applies to screens with max-width of 570px.
> - On Tablet size one item in Drinks menu is centralized instead of aligning with the rest of the items. This bug is left unfixed.
> - Social media links takes you to main page of social media platform. This is because the barbershop
 is not real and have no social media.
> - Bad performance result while testing the site performance. Tried multiple things to try to fix this. Make images smaller, compress images and gzip compression.
> - Noticed that bootstrap added a margin-bottom .5rem in the labels in the book a table form. Removed this to align with margin on the rest of the form.
> - Error in the bootstrap in class row, change the line comand for new bootstrap.
