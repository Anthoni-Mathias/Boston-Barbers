## Description

> This is My second Milestone Project at Code Institute. In this project I will create an interactive website with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

> Boston Barbers Bar is a BaberShop with the goal to reach out the local community to showcase their style and to add possibility for costumers to book a time for hair cut or shave beard. This is reached with a neat design with only relevant features and intuitive interactivity to get a clear and good user experience.

### Strategy

> To align with the Business goals potential customer research has been done to answer some questions:
>
> - What do you most use this kind of website for?
> - What do you do before/after using this kind of website?
> - What makes a good experience?
> - What do you expect when visiting this kind of website?

> The result from this research is a website with only a few key functions to accomplish what the customers are looking for. A simple, not so busy site with clear steps to take to do what we want.
